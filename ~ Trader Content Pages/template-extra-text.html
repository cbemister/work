    <h1 class="widget-heading">Jeep Grand Cherokee L</h1>
    <p class="TextInner">Jeep expanded its Grand Cherokee lineup with its latest model--the Grand Cherokee L. Larger than the existing version, it offers a first for the Grand Cherokee model--three rows of seats that can accommodate up to seven passengers. The Grand Cherokee has long been a staple of the mid-size SUV class, and the L model now allows it to better compete with other three-row vehicles in its class. The Grand Cherokee L features a sportier cabin environment filled with more modern infotainment technology and is available in four trim levels across Canada: Limited, Overland, Summit, and Summit Reserve. Starting at $59,995, the Limited model is more than capable of tackling whatever drivers need to, and it allows them to do it in style. The Limited comes standard with Capri leather-faced seats, heated first and second row seats, off-road information pages, power liftgate, remote start system, and Quadra-Trac I 4x4 System with Jeep Selec-Terrain Traction Management System.</p>

    <p class="accordionText">Jeep includes its 3.6-litre Pentastar VVT V6 engine as standard on all Grand Cherokee L trims, but a 5.7-litre HEMI VVT V8 is available on all trim levels except the entry-level Limited. These product 290 hp and 357 hp, respectively, but those seeking to maximize towing capacity should go with the V8, which can tow 3,265kg compared to the V6's 2,812kg. The latest in the Grand Cherokee line, the Grand Cherokee L offers legendary 4x4 capability, an elevated interior, sculpted exterior design, and for the first time ever, three rows of seating.</br></br>There are several facts that seem to remain steady across time--the sun rises in the east, the early bird gets the worm, and Jeep offers the Grand Cherokee SUV in its lineup. But now, for the first time ever, Jeep has introduced a Grand Cherokee with three rows of seating. The Grand Cherokee L offers the brand's legendary capability, luxurious interior, bold exterior design, and enough seating for seven passengers. In addition to room for seven, the interior offers an appropriately grandiose design with classic materials, detailed craftsmanship, and an innovative design. </p>

   <The class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 secondColumn">
    <p class="accordionText">Luxurious comfort is present throughout the interior as well, thanks to available leather-trimmed seating, quad-zone temperature control, and ambient LED lighting. The three-row setup of the Grand Cherokee L offers abundant legroom to all passengers and the option for the standard second-row bucket or available bench seating, as well as a 50/50 split-folding third-row bench seat.</br></br>Outside, the Grand Cherokee L is instantly recognizable as a Jeep but it offers streamlined styling and an elevated appearance thanks to a resculpted profile and leaner, more aerodynamic look. The lowered, tapered roof and longer hood and cab give the Grand Cherokee L a more rounded appearance compared to boxier versions of yesteryear. The signature seven-slot grille was also updated with elegant trim and larger openings that emphasize the vehicle's width. All-new slim LED headlights and larger, geometric-shaped front fascia complete this contemporary look. With style inside and out and a starting price under $60,000 with many high-class standard features, the Jeep Grand Cherokee L is a great, new, and adventurous option for drivers wanting additional seating without giving up comfort and capability. </p>
